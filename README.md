# SQL Project: Data Job Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes job data using SQL queries to extract insights about employment trends, salary distributions, job roles, and locations. The dataset is stored in a relational database, and queries are executed using SQL.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses job data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL
- Extracts meaningful insights on job trends, salaries, and demand
- Uses SQL queries for data aggregation and filtering
- Visualizes job trends using graphical charts

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite (depending on your database choice)
- SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver)
- Python (optional, for additional data processing and visualization)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical outputs

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/banuprasadvitta/SQL_Project_Data_Job_Analysis.git
   cd SQL_Project_Data_Job_Analysis
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Create a new database in MySQL/PostgreSQL
   - Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables and insert sample data

3. Load the dataset:
   - Import the CSV file into your SQL database
   - Use `LOAD DATA INFILE` (MySQL) or `COPY` (PostgreSQL) to bulk load data

## Usage
Run SQL queries to analyze job data:
```sql
SELECT job_title, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM jobs
GROUP BY job_title
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

For Python-based analysis and visualization, install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib seaborn
```
Then use Pandas and Seaborn to fetch and visualize data:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Connect to database
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/jobdb')
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT job_title, salary FROM jobs", engine)

# Plot salary distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.histplot(df['salary'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Salary Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Salary')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

## Graphical Insights
Here are some graphical representations of the job data:
1. **Salary Distribution Chart**: Shows the spread of salaries in the dataset.
2. **Job Roles vs. Average Salary**: Bar chart comparing salaries across job titles.
3. **Job Openings by Location**: Heatmap of job demand across different locations.

## Error Handling
- **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure your database is running and credentials are correct.
- **Syntax Errors**: Check SQL queries for typos or incorrect column/table names.
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize queries using indexes and efficient filtering.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement interactive dashboards for visualization
- Automate data updates using ETL pipelines
- Integrate AI-powered job trend predictions
